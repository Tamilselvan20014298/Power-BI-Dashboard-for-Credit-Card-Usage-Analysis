# Power-BI-Dashboard-for-Credit-Card-Usage-Analysis

## Steps to Build the Dashboard

### 1. Data Importation
Import datasets from relevant sources, such as databases or CSV files, into Power BI.
Ensure datasets, including customer details and transaction details, are loaded correctly.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
**Data Cleaning**: Ensure that fields like `customer_age`, `income`, `week_start_date`, `annual_fees`, `total_trans_amt and `interest_earned` are free of missing or inconsistent data.
Data Type Assignment**: Validate that all columns have appropriate data types:
Date for `week_start_date`
Integer for `customer_age`
Decimal for `income`

### 3. Data Analysis and Visualizations
**Revenue Trends**: Create a line chart to compare revenue over time (e.g., weekly or quarterly).

**Age Group Distribution**: Use bar or pie charts to visualize the distribution of customers across different age groups.

**Income Group Contribution**: Highlight revenue contributions by income groups using bar charts or slicers.

**Geographical Insights**: Display revenue by top states (e.g., TX, NY, CA, FL, NJ) on a map visual.

**Card Category Performance**: Use bar charts to show revenue generated by card categories (e.g., Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum).

**Revenue by Expenditure Type**: Analyze revenue breakdown across expenditure types (e.g., fuel, grocery, entertainment) using stacked bar charts.
