# Power-BI-Dashboard-for-Credit-Card-Usage-Analysis

## Steps to Build the Dashboard

### 1. Data Importation
Import datasets from relevant sources, such as databases or CSV files, into Power BI.
Ensure datasets, including customer details and transaction details, are loaded correctly.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
**Data Cleaning**: Ensure that fields like `customer_age`, `income`, `week_start_date`, `annual_fees`, `total_trans_amt and `interest_earned` are free of missing or inconsistent data.
Data Type Assignment**: Validate that all columns have appropriate data types:
Date for `week_start_date`
Integer for `customer_age`
Decimal for `income`
